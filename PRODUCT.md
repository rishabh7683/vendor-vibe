## Shopify Advanced Merchant Dashboard - Product Specification

**1. Overview**

*   **Goal:** Create a comprehensive, visually stunning, and insightful frontend dashboard for Shopify merchants using mock data. It aims to provide analytics far exceeding the standard Shopify reports, focusing on profitability, trends, customer behavior, app performance, and operational efficiency.
*   **Target Audience:** Internal stakeholders (e.g., your bosses) to showcase the potential value of advanced analytics.
*   **Key Differentiator:** Depth of analysis (e.g., seasonality, app ROI simulation), focus on profitability, and superior UI/UX.
*   **Constraint:** Frontend only, using generated mock data. No live API integration or backend database.

**2. Core Principles**

*   **Visually Driven:** Emphasis on clear, interactive charts, graphs, and data visualizations. Modern and professional aesthetic.
*   **Insight-Focused:** Prioritize actionable insights, comparisons (vs. previous periods, goals), and trend identification over raw data dumps.
*   **Holistic View:** Cover all major aspects of an e-commerce business: Sales, Products, Customers, Marketing, Operations, Apps, and Finances (simulated).
*   **User-Friendly:** Intuitive navigation and clear presentation of complex data.

**4. Mock Data Requirements**

*   Need a robust mock data generation strategy (e.g., using Faker.js or a similar library).
*   Data needs to be interconnected and realistic enough to support the analytics (e.g., customers having multiple orders, orders containing products with COGS, seasonal sales patterns baked in, mock UTM parameters, app cost data).

**5. UI/UX Vision**

*   Clean, modern, professional design. Inspiration from leading SaaS analytics platforms (e.g., Amplitude, Mixpanel, modern BI tools).
*   Heavy use of interactive charts (lines, bars, pies, heatmaps, maps) using a suitable library (Recharts, Chart.js, Nivo, etc.).
*   Clear data tables with sorting, filtering, and potentially export options.
*   Responsive layout (primarily desktop-focused, but adaptable).
